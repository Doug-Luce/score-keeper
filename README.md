# score-keeper
A MeteorJS application for keeping score.

Thanks for taking a look at this project. This is the first project I've built with MeteorJS, and I've
learned so much during this project. The DDP protocol that updates the minimongo database to the real MongoDB is
awesome, the speed of which the app reacts to events it amazing. During this project I learned how to better structure applications,
SCSS, and some more ReactJS.

Thanks again for taking a look!
